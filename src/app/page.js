        <p className="pt-0 p-3">
         The 1st International Conference on “Sustainable Mechanical Engineering and
           Design” [ICSMED 2025] focuses on innovative approaches and advancements in
          technology that promote sustainability. In the face of unprecedented environmental
          challenges and the urgent need for sustainable development, the International
          Conference on Sustainable Technology convenes a diverse assembly of scholars,
          industry leaders, policymakers, and advocates dedicated to advancing sustainable
          practices and innovations. This conference serves as a vital platform for sharing
          knowledge, showcasing cutting-edge research, and fostering collaborative solutions
          that address the complex interplay between technology and sustainability.
          Recognizing that the health of our planet is intricately linked to our technological
          advancements, we aim to explore pathways that not only mitigate environmental
          impact but also promote social equity and economic resilience. Through engaging
          discussions, hands-on workshops, and dynamic presentations, we aspire to inspire
          action and empower stakeholders to implement sustainable technologies that pave
          the way for a more sustainable future. Together, let us harness the power of
          innovation and collaboration to create solutions that benefit both current and future
          generations........

           was established in 2014 under the aegis of Pimpri Chinchwad Education Trust (PCET). Presently the Institute offers NBA accredited UG Programmes in four disciplines viz. Civil Engineering, Computer Engineering, E&TC Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and also offers Information Technology. PCCOE&R is affiliated to Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU), Pune and is approved by A.I.C.T.E., New Delhi, Govt. of Maharashtra, D.T.E, Mumbai. Recently the Institute has been accredited with A++ grade by NAAC in the very first cycle of accreditation.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Right from its inception, PCCOER has adopted Outcome Based Education (OBE) and Student-centric approach. We work on a Four-Pillar Philosophy, the four pillars of our Institute being;
            <ul className="list-disc p-3">
              <li>Academic Excellence
              </li>
              <li>Research & Innovation</li>
              <li>Professional Competence and</li>
              <li>Social Commitment.</li>
            </ul>
            <br></br>
            Institute has experienced, dedicated and highly qualified faculty (29 Doctorates and 44 pursuing PhD), state-of-art infrastructure and an environment conducive to learning, research and innovation, which has culminated into PCCOE&R being among top Five Institutions in SPPU results. In a very short span from its commencement, PCCOER has produced 9 University Rankers.
