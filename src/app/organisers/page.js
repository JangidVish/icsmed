        </h2>
        <p className="text-justify mb-4">
          Mechanical engineering is one of the broadest engineering disciplines.
          Mechanical engineers design, develop, build and test. They deal with
          anything that moves, from components to machines to the human body.
          Mechanical engineering combines creativity, knowledge and analytical
          tools to complete the difficult tasks of shaping an idea into reality.
          Mechanical engineers can look for employment in diverse areas,
          including manufacturing, aerospace, automotive, biomedical, chemical,
          computer, communications, nanotechnology, power-generation industries,
          engineering consultancies, energy utilities. government Jobs etc.
          <br></br>A Mechanical Engineer can also pursue his/her career in the
          public sector through competitive exams like UPSC, MPSC, IES. They can
