        The 1st International Conference on “Sustainable Mechanical Engineering
        and Design” [ICSMED 2025] focuses on innovative approaches and
        advancements in technology that promote sustainability. In the face of
        unprecedented environmental challenges and the urgent need for
        sustainable development, the International Conference on Sustainable
        Technology convenes a diverse assembly of scholars, industry leaders,
        policymakers, and advocates dedicated to advancing sustainable practices
        and innovations. This conference serves as a vital platform for sharing
        knowledge, showcasing cutting-edge research, and fostering collaborative
        solutions that address the complex interplay between technology and
        sustainability. Recognizing that the health of our planet is intricately
        linked to our technological advancements, we aim to explore pathways
        that not only mitigate environmental impact but also promote social
        equity and economic resilience. Through engaging discussions, hands-on
        workshops, and dynamic presentations, we aspire to inspire action and
        empower stakeholders to implement sustainable technologies that pave the
        way for a more sustainable future. Together, let us harness the power of
        innovation and collaboration to create solutions that benefit both
